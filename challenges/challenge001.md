# Stake Wars Challenge 001
Published on: May 25th 2020

Create your BetaNet wallet, deploy your node, and correctly configure your staking pool.
This challenge is designed to 

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Generate your wallet
2. Deploy your NEAR node
3. Configure your Staking Pool

## 1.Generate your wallet

You have to install [near-shell](https://github.com/near/near-shell), a Node.js application that relies on nearlib to generate secure keys, connect to the NEAR platform and send transactions to the network on your behalf.
You don't have to install near-shell on your validator node - on the contrary, it's suggested to keep your staking wallet on a different machine.

**Heads up:** please be sure to have Node 10+ installed before trying to run near shell

1. Create and `cd` a directory you'd like to work in, such as `mkdir stakewars && cd stakewars`
2. Download `near-shell` with `npm install -g near-shell`
3. Set your NODE_ENV to betanet. You can do this in `bash` with the command `export NODE_ENV=betanet`
4. Run `near login` and copy/paste the link from the instructions that take you to the wallet
5. If you are not redirected, correctly set the `account_ID` in near-shell

This process will authorize the additional `signer key` to your `account_ID`, enabling near-shell to control your wallet from the command-line interface.

Once your shell is authorized to ontrol your `account_ID`, you can create the account for your staking pool, which we call `stakingPool_ID`. Launch the command `near create_account stakingPool_ID --masterAccount=account_ID`, where `stakingPool_ID` will be used by your delegators, and will be used when you launch your NEAR node the first time.
This operation will create a new file in the folder `~/.near-credentials/betanet/` with the same name of your stakingPool ID. It's a good practice to make a backup of this file, and preserve its private key.

Confused? Read more on the differences between `signer keys`, `validator keys` and `node keys` in the official [documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/validator/keys).


## 2.Deploy your NEAR node

Setup a validator machine that follows the [hardware requirements](https://docs.near.org/docs/roles/validator/hardware). If you use a firewall, set the rules to allow traffic to port `24567` from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0).
Once your machine is ready, install [nearup](https://github.com/near/nearup). Nearup provides simplified tools to run NEAR using Docker, and is designed to help developers who need a local RPC for their applications - it is not designed for professional validators who run NEAR infrastructure.

Take your time to understand how to manually update [nearcore](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore), and how to properly use the command `nearup betanet --nodocker --binary-path` (see below for contribution opportunities).
Configure your node to run on `betanet`, so download and compile `nearcore` from its [beta branch](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/tree/beta).

**Heads up:** the first time you run `nearup` it will ask you to input your account ID:
```
Enter your account ID (leave empty if not going to be a validator):
```
Your validator node will run the staking pool, so the account to use here is `stakingPool_ID` and **not** the master account.

Export your validator key by typing the command `cat ~/.near/betanet/validator_key.json | grep public_key` as it will be needed to configure the staking pool contract.

## 3.Configure your Staking Pool

This is the core part of this challenge! 

### 3.1. Preparation: unstake any currently locked funds and install Rustup

If you were already a validator on BetaNet, and you were using the legacy `near stake` command, follow the commands below before proceeding:
1. Issue `export NODE_ENV=betanet` command before performing any unstaking, so your near shell will connect to `betanet` RPC.
2. Unstake your previously locked funds, by setting stake to zero: `near stake account_ID <staking public key> 0` - where the public key and the account ID are the same you used when you initially issued the staking transaction.

Please note that your staked funds will require three epochs to be available (9 hours on BetaNet). Once the funds are unlocked, you can stop nearup with the command `nearup stop`, cleanup the folder `~/.near/betanet` on your validator node, and start nearcore again, repeating the command `nearup` command at the step 2.

If you are already running a previous version of the staking pool, deployed without following this guide, jump to **step 3.6** before proceeding.

Once your node is not anymore a validator, and you have a new `validator_key.json` available, you can begin your deployment process for the staking pool:
1. Proceed to install Rustup: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh`
2. If you receive the alert that is already present, be sure to update with the command `rustup update stable`
3. Setup the correct rustup target, with the command `rustup +stable target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

Please note that some operating systems (such as Ubuntu Server) already come with Rust installed, but the available version may be outdated for NEAR. Please refer to the official [Rustup website](https://rustup.rs/) for more specific instructions and troubleshooting.

### 3.2. Build the new staking pool contract

1. Be sure to be in your in your `stakewars` work directory: `cd ~/stakewars`
2. Clone and deploy the staking pool contract: `git clone https://github.com/near/initial-contracts && cd initial-contracts/staking-pool`
3. Configure rustup with the needed target `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
4. Build your staking pool contract: `./build.sh`

### 3.3. Launch your new validator node

2. Launch your node with the command `nearup betanet --nodocker`. Modify the launch command according to your actual validator configuration (e.g. `--nodocker` and `--binary-path` if you compiled your binaries)
3. Nearup may ask again for the validator ID to use. Put here your staking pool account (which we called `stakingPool_ID` in the steps above)
5. Note your validator public key, or issue the command `cat ~/.near/betanet/validator_key.json |grep "public_key"` before going to the next step

### 3.4. Deploy your staking pool

1. From `near shell`, be sure that you are logged in and you have the key to manage `stakingPool_ID` account: `ls ~/.near-credentials/betanet`. If not present, recover your staking pool keys from the backup at the step 1 above, and copy them in the appropriate folder.
2. Deploy the staking pool contract on your account: `near deploy --accountId=stakingPool_ID --wasmFile=initial-contracts/staking-pool/res/staking_pool.wasm`
3. Proceed to initialize your staking pool account `stakingPool_ID` for the owner account ID `stakingPool_ID`, and a given a 10% reward fee:
	```
	near call stakingPool_ID new '{"owner_id": "stakingPool_ID", "stake_public_key": "CE3QAXyVLeScmY9YeEyR3Tw9yXfjBPzFLzroTranYtVb", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 10, "denominator": 100}}' --account_id stakingPool_ID
	```
	Please node that `stake_public_key` can be with or without the `ed25519:` prefix.

You're almost there!

### 3.5. Delegate your unstaked funds to the staking pool

1. From your usual near-shell machine, deposit the funds from your master account to the staking pool: `near call stakingPool_ID deposit '{}' --accountId account_ID --amount 100`
2. Stake your deposited funds, with the command `near call stakingPool_ID stake '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId account_ID`

**Heads up:** the amount that you deposit is in $NEAR, while the amount in the argument is in YoctoNEAR. `1` $NEAR is `1*10^24` YoctoNEAR (1 followed by 24 zeroes. Therefore:

| NEAR |  YoctoNEAR  | YoctoNEAR |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------|
| `1` | `1*10^24` | `1000000000000000000000000` |
| `10` | `1*10^25` | `10000000000000000000000000` |
| `100` | `1*10^26` | `100000000000000000000000000` |
| `1,000` | `1*10^27` | `1000000000000000000000000000` |
| `10,000` | `1*10^28` | `10000000000000000000000000000` |

We strongly suggest to get confidence with the `staking pool` contract, by reading more on the official initial-contracts repo on [Github](https://github.com/near/initial-contracts/tree/master/staking-pool).

### 3.6. Delete the access keys and lock your staking pool

Correctly use near-shell to delete any access keys from your staking pool. Please get confidence with this tool and lock the right keys, as it may lock your funds by removing any access to your main wallet.
1. List the access keys of your staking pool contract: `near keys stakingPool_ID | grep public_key`
2. Lock your contract, by removing the keys associated with your contract: `near delete-key --accessKey <PUBKEY> --accountId stakingPoolID`

If successfully performed, you should see an entry on the [BetaNet explorer](https://explorer.betanet.near.org):

![alt text](../media/deleted_key.png "Access Key successfully deleted")


### 3.7. Update an old version of the staking pool (optional)

The failsafe method is to deploy a new `stakingPool_ID` from step 1 of this challenge, unstake your funds from the old pool with the command `near call stakingPool_ID unstake` (see below for more details), and use them on the new pool. Only when the new node becomes validator, you can shut down the old node, and remove the pool.

At a high level, the steps to follow are:

1. Unstake your funds: `near call stakingPool_ID unstake '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId account_ID`
2. **IMPORTANT** Wait for 3 epochs (9 hours on BetaNet) to withdraw. To check if the staked NEAR is ready to withdraw, use the command `near view stakingPool_ID is_account_unstaked_balance_available '{"account_id": "account_ID"}' --accountId account_ID`
3. Once your funds are unlocked, withdraw them with the command `near call stakingPool_ID withdraw '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId account_ID`

Once completed, you are deady to get back to the step 3.2 and deploy a new staking pool contract.
